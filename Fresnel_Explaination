##  Fresnel Zones & Earth Bulge

### Why Free Space Isn't Quite Free

While free space path loss assumes perfect vacuum, real-world radio links must consider:

###  Fresnel Zones
**The donut-shaped regions** around the direct path where radio waves can interfere constructively or destructively.

```matlab
% Calculate 1st Fresnel zone radius
[radius, clearance] = fresnelZoneCalculator(10000, 6e9);
fprintf('10km at 6GHz: %.1fm radius, %.1fm clearance needed\n', radius, clearance);
